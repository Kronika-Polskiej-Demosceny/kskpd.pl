      <description>Thanks to the support of the National Heritage Institute under the &amp;ldquo;Intangible – Pass It On&amp;rdquo; program, and in cooperation with the distinguished sociologist Dr. Patryk Wasiak, we have released an album titled &amp;ldquo;Polish Demoscene as a Community. Informal Practices of Polish Demoscene Contacts&amp;rdquo;.&#xA;Our goal was to gather, preserve, and disseminate knowledge about the communication practices and the creation of their own identity by the Polish demoscene. The same demoscene that we managed to register on the National List of Intangible Cultural Heritage.</description>

Programs, music, and graphics are created on a variety of computer equipment, often pushing beyond its technical specifications — all in the name of art.&#xA;The Social Committee “Chronicle of the Polish Demoscene” closely cooperated with demoscene teams, cultural organizations, and individuals conducting research on digital culture and art.&#xA;It all began somewhere in 2019, from a tweet announcing the creation of the international initiative The Art of Coding, aimed at recognizing demoscene creativity as craftsmanship and art, whose development is part of the contemporary history of humanity.</description>
